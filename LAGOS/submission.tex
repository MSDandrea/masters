\section{Introduction}\label{intro}

\section{Come√ßou}

{\sc Coloring($r,\ell$)} can be easily solved in polynomial time when $(r,\ell) \in \{(0,1),(1,0),(1,1),(2,0)\}$.
Therefore, in order to completely classify the complexity when $r+\ell \leq 2$ remains to analyse the $(0,2)$-case.

	\begin{lemma}
{\sc Coloring($0,2$)} can be solved in polynomial time.
\end{lemma}
	\begin{proof}
$(0,2)$-graphs, also known as co-bipartite, is a subclass of perfect graphs~\cite{bollo98}, consequently its chromatic number
equals to its clique number, which can be found in polinomial time using a polynomial algorithm for {\sc Independent Set}
on bipartite graphs (see~\cite{konig31,zing12}).
	\end{proof}

As $(3,0)$-graphs (tripartite graphs) have chromatic number at most three, and to verify if the chromatic number of a graph $G$
is one or two is trivial, we know that {\sc Coloring($3,0$)} can be solved in polynomial time.
Next we consider $(4,0)$-graphs.

\begin{lemma}
{\sc Coloring($4,0$)} is NP-Complete.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
It is well-known that any planar graph is $(4,0)$ (4-colorable)~\cite{appel77}, and X and Y provide an $O(n^2)$ algorithm to find a 4-coloring of a planar graph.
In addition, to determine whether a planar graph $G$ is 3-colorable is NP-complete~\cite{larry} (even when a $(4,0)$-partition of $G$ is also provided).
Therefore to determine the chromatic number of $(4,0)$-graphs is NP-complete.
\end{proof}

Is noticeable that any $(r,\ell)$-graph is simultaneously a $(r+1,\ell)$-graph and a $(r,\ell+1)$-graph, since we can choose any vertex to act as both independent set and a clique. Therefore we can state that the problem is NP-Complete for any $(r,\ell)$-graphs $\forall r \geq 4 , \ell \geq 0$

The following theorem serves as base for the next demonstrations.

\begin{theorem}
  {\sc List-Coloring$(r,\ell)$} is equivalent to {\sc Coloring$(r,\ell+1)$}.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    Let $G$ be the graph of an instance of {\sc List-Coloring$(r,\ell)$}, and $C=\{c_1,c_2,\ldots,c_n\}$ the color set formed by the lists of colors for each vertex.

    For each color $c_i \in C$ create a vertex $u_i$ and connects it to all others $u_j\; \forall j < i$. If a vertex $v \in V(G)$ does not have the color $c_i$ in its list, then adds an edge from $v$ to $u_i$. This steps generates a new graph $H$. It is simple to notice that if $H$ can be proper colored, then we found a solution to the {\sc List-Coloring} of $G$.

    The counterpart of the prof can be done by finding the maximum clique $Q$ of $H$ and building the color list of the remaining vertices $v$ as follow:

    $\forall u_i \in Q$ if $(v,u_i) \notin E(H)$ adds $c_i$ to the list of $v$. Note that $H\backslash Q = G$ and therefore a solution for {\sc List-Coloring} of $G$ can be easily extended to the {\sc Coloring} of $H$.
\end{proof}

Based in the previous demonstration we can extract the following corollaries

\begin{corollary}
  {\sc Coloring$(1,2)$} is NP-Complete.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
  Derivates from the NP-Completeness of list coloring on split graphs \cite{jansen1997}.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
  {\sc Coloring$(2,1)$ is Np-Complete.}
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
  Derivates from the NP-Completeness of bipartite graphs demonstrated by Fellows at \cite{fellows07}
\end{proof}

Now remain to us to demonstrate the complexity of {\sc Coloring(0,2)}. In order to do so we will use the following theorem, which is based on a theorem proposed by Jensen et.al \cite{jansen1999}. The proof is based on a reduction of the {\sc Restricted 3-SAT} problem to the {\sc List-Coloring(0,2)}

\textbf{Restricted 3-SAT}

\textbf{Given:} A set of unnegated variables $X = \{x_1,\ldots,x_n\}$ and negated variables  $\overline{X} = \{\overline{x}_1,\ldots,\overline{x}_n\}$, a collection of clauses $c_1,\ldots,c_m$ such that
\begin{itemize}
  \item each clause $c_i$ contains two or three different literals $y_{i,k} \in X \cup \overline{X}$
  \item there are at most three clauses that contain $x_j$ or $\overline{x}_j$ for each $1 \leq j \leq n$.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Question:}  Does there exists a truth assignment for the variables such that each clause is satisfied?

\begin{theorem}
  {\sc List-Coloring(0,2) is Np-Complete}
\end{theorem}


\begin{proof}
Let $I$ be a instance of a restricted 3-SAT problem, we construct an instance $I'$ of list-coloring(0,2) problem as follows:

For each variable $j$ we create six vertices $a_j^{(1)}$, $a_j^{(2)}$, $a_j^{(3)}$;	$b_j^{(1)}$, $b_j^{(2)}$, $b_j^{(3)}$. each vertex has a color set as follow:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item $a_j^{(k)}$ := \{$x_j^{(k)}$, $\overline{x_j}^{(k)}$ \}
    \item $b_j^{(k)}$ := \{$\overline{x_j}^{(k)}$,$x_j^{((k \Mod{3}) + 1 )}$ \}
  \end{itemize}

Let $A$ be the set of all $a_j^{(k)}$ and $B$ the set of all $b_j^{(k)}$ build a clique with $A \cup B$.
Note that this clique can only be colored in two manners:
\begin{itemize}
	\item (1)  $f(a_j^{(k)}) = x_j^{(k)} => b_j^{(k)} = \overline{x_j}^{(k)}$
	\item (2)  $f(a_j^{(k)}) = \overline{x_j}^{(k)} => b_j^{(k)} = x_j^{((k \Mod{3}) + 1 )}$
\end{itemize}

Futhermore, for each clause create a vertex $c_i$ and populate their lists as follows:

For each variable $j$ or the negation of it $\overline{j}$ in the clause $i$, adds $x_j^{(k)}$ to the list of $c_i$ where k is the current number of occurences of $j$.
For example, let $I$ be the following 3-SAT:

$(p \lor q \lor r) \land (\neg{p} \lor q \lor r) \land (\neg{p} \lor \neg{r} \lor s)$

their clauses would be transformed in these vertex:
\begin{itemize}
	\item $c_1$ with list: \{$p^1$, $q^1$, $r^1$ \}
	\item $c_2$ with list: \{$\overline{p}^2$, $q^2$, $r^2$ \}
	\item $c_3$ with list: \{$\overline{p}^3$, $\overline{r}^3$, $s^1$ \}
\end{itemize}

		Let $C$ be the set containing all $c_i$ build a clique with $C \cup A$.

    Using the variable $p$ to demonstrate, if $p$ is {\sc true} then $a_p^{(1)},a_p^{(2)},a_p^{(3)}$ shall be colored with $p'^1,p'^2,p'^3$, allowing the color $p^x$,and denying the color $p'^x$ to be choosed to color a clause or another variable in the neighbourhood of $a_p^{(1)},a_p^{(2)},a_p^{(3)}$.

    Therefore is easy to see that if $I'$ can be list-colored then exists a truth assignment in $I$ that satisfies each clause. And that by construction if a thruth assignment satisfies $I$ then exists a list-coloring of $I'$ in the following way:

    \[color(a_j^{(k)})=
    \begin{cases}
       x_j^{(k)}, \text{}\\
       \overline{x}_j^{(k)},
    \end{cases}
    \]
\end{proof}
