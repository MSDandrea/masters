\section{Introduction}\label{intro}

\section{Come√ßou}

{\sc Coloring($r,\ell$)} can be easily solved in polynomial time when $(r,\ell) \in \{(0,1),(1,0),(1,1),(2,0)\}$.
Therefore, in order to completely classify the complexity when $r+\ell \leq 2$ remains to analyse the $(0,2)$-case.

	\begin{lemma}
{\sc Coloring($0,2$)} can be solved in polynomial time.
\end{lemma}
	\begin{proof}
$(0,2)$-graphs, also known as co-bipartite, is a subclass of perfect graphs~\cite{bollo98}, consequently its chromatic number
equals to its clique number, which can be found in polinomial time using a polynomial algorithm for {\sc Independent Set}
on bipartite graphs (see~\cite{konig31,zing12}).
	\end{proof}

As $(3,0)$-graphs (tripartite graphs) have chromatic number at most three, and to verify if the chromatic number of a graph $G$
is one or two is trivial, we know that {\sc Coloring($3,0$)} can be solved in polynomial time.
Next we consider $(4,0)$-graphs.

\begin{lemma}
{\sc Coloring($4,0$)} is NP-Complete.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
It is well-known that any planar graph is $(4,0)$ (4-colorable)~\cite{appel77}, and X and Y provide an $O(n^2)$ algorithm to find a 4-coloring of a planar graph.
In addition, to determine whether a planar graph $G$ is 3-colorable is NP-complete~\cite{larry} (even when a $(4,0)$-partition of $G$ is also provided).
Therefore to determine the chromatic number of $(4,0)$-graphs is NP-complete.
\end{proof}

Is noticeable that any $(r,\ell)$-graph is simultaneously a $(r+1,\ell)$-graph and a $(r,\ell+1)$-graph, since we can choose any vertex to act as both independent set and a clique. Therefore we can state that the problem is NP-Complete for any $(r,\ell)$-graphs $\forall r \geq 4 , \ell \geq 0$

The following theorem serves as base for the next demonstrations.

\begin{theorem}
  {\sc List-Coloring$(r,\ell)$} is equivalent to {\sc Coloring$(r,\ell+1)$}.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    Let $G$ be the graph of an instance of {\sc List-Coloring$(r,\ell)$}, and $C=\{c_1,c_2,\ldots,c_n\}$ the color set formed by the lists of colors for each vertex.

    For each color $c_i \in C$ create a vertex $u_i$ and connects it to all others $u_j\; \forall j < i$. If a vertex $v \in V(G)$ does not have the color $c_i$ in its list, then adds an edge from $v$ to $u_i$. This steps generates a new graph $H$. It is simple to notice that if $H$ can be proper colored, then we found a solution to the {\sc List-Coloring} of $G$.

    The counterpart of the prof can be done by finding the maximum clique $Q$ of $H$ and building the color list of the remaining vertices $v$ as follow:

    $\forall u_i \in Q$ if $(v,u_i) \notin E(H)$ adds $c_i$ to the list of $v$. Note that $H\backslash Q = G$ and therefore a solution for {\sc List-Coloring} of $G$ can be easily extended to the {\sc Coloring} of $H$.
\end{proof}

Based in the previous demonstration we can extract the following corollaries

\begin{corollary}
  {\sc Coloring$(1,2)$} is NP-Complete.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
  Derivates from the NP-Completeness of list coloring on split graphs \cite{jansen1997}.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
  {\sc Coloring$(2,1)$ is Np-Complete.}
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
  Derivates from the NP-Completeness of bipartite graphs demonstrated by Fellows at \cite{fellows07}
\end{proof}

Now remain to us to demonstrate the complexity of {\sc Coloring(0,2)}. In order to do so we will use the following theorem, which is based on a theorem proposed by Jensen et.al \cite{jansen1999}. 

\begin{theorem} 
  {\sc List-Coloring(0,2) is Np-Complete}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
\end{proof}
