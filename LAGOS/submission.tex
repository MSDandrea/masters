\section{Introduction}\label{intro}

\section{Come√ßou}

{\sc Coloring($r,\ell$)} can be easily solved in polynomial time when $(r,\ell) \in \{(0,1),(1,0),(1,1),(2,0)\}$.
Therefore, in order to completely classify the complexity when $r+\ell \leq 2$ remains to analyse the $(0,2)$-case.

	\begin{lemma}
{\sc Coloring($0,2$)} can be solved in polynomial time.
\end{lemma}
	\begin{proof}
$(0,2)$-graphs, also known as co-bipartite, is a subclass of perfect graphs~\cite{bollo98}, consequently its chromatic number
equals to its clique number, which can be found in polinomial time using a polynomial algorithm for {\sc Independent Set}
on bipartite graphs (see~\cite{konig31,zing12}).
	\end{proof}

As $(3,0)$-graphs (tripartite graphs) have chromatic number at most three, and to verify if the chromatic number of a graph $G$
is one or two is trivial, we know that {\sc Coloring($3,0$)} can be solved in polynomial time.
Next we consider $(4,0)$-graphs.

\begin{lemma}
{\sc Coloring($4,0$)} is NP-Complete.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
It is well-known that any planar graph is $(4,0)$ (4-colorable)~\cite{appel77}, and X and Y provide an $O(n^2)$ algorithm to find a 4-coloring of a planar graph.
In addition, to determine whether a planar graph $G$ is 3-colorable is NP-complete~\cite{larry} (even when a $(4,0)$-partition of $G$ is also provided).
Therefore to determine the chromatic number of $(4,0)$-graphs is NP-complete.
\end{proof}
